# TANDEM
<p>CastingCallClub is for animation teams, Bandmix is for bands, and everyone else...</p>
<p>We're pretty much screwed.</p>
<p>That's what TANDEM is here to fix. It's meant to be a place where creatives of all kinds can come together to work on all kinds of projects.</p>

## TEAMS
<p>You're a comic writer who needs an artist? A game dev who doesn't understand 3D modelling? There's someone out there who would love to help you with your passion project. You just need to find them.</p>
<p>TANDEM Teams are designed to help with this - project managers create them, list the needed roles, and send them out into the internet. People who are interested in filling these roles submit manager-defined applications to join, managers accept them, and boom. You have a creative team.</p>
